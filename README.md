## Ads and trackers
Ads and tracking hosts I have seen around the Internet. Some are rare. Some are popular.

## Scams and phishing
Because they don't deserve your traffic.

## Possibilities
Domains that may be problematic. If anyone knows anything about these, please let me know. I do not recommend using this on a daily basis.

## Not Good Pi
A simple hosts file, made to block sites that are offering Pi-hole as a scam. NOTE: this list will no longer be maintained. It is available for legacy reasons only. Domains under this category will go under Scams and phishing.


# Do I have a false positive?
Please, create an issue to let me know.
