# infinitytec's blocklists

## Ads and trackers
Ads and tracking hosts I have seen around the Internet. Some are rare. Some are popular.

[Hosts file format](https://github.com/infinitytec/blocklists/raw/master/ads-and-trackers.txt)

## Scams and phishing
Because they don't deserve your traffic. Blocked include financial schemes, imitation sites, malware, and people trying to take advantage of others through various things including fake news and misleading information.

This blocklist receives frequent updates.

## Adfilters
Adfilters in the format used by uBlock Origin and Adblock Plus. Has a lot of mobile ad rules as well.

Also receives frequent updates.

## Annoyances
Just some things (like cookie banners) I find annoying.

## Medical Pseudoscience
Blocks sites such as antivax sites and misleading medical information and "snake oil." Note that I am not a doctor; consult a medical professional for any medical advice.

## Possibilities
Domains that may be problematic. If anyone knows anything about these, please let me know. I do not recommend using this on a daily basis, as they may just break things.

## Not Good Pi
No longer maintained in favor of the more generic (and much larger) scams and phishing list.

# A note on formats:
Hosts format blocklists work with browser extensions such as [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and with DNS ad blockers such as [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/).
Static filters work with uBlock Origin and similar adblockers.

# Do I have a false positive?
Please, create an issue to let me know, or [Contact me](https://infinitytec.github.io/contact/contact.html).

# Is your site on a list and you think it should not be?
Create an issue letting me know. If you make a good case for why I should remove it, I will remove it from the list.
