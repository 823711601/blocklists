# infinitytec's blocklists

## Ads and trackers
Ads and tracking hosts I have seen around the Internet. Some are rare. Some are popular.

[Hosts file format](https://github.com/infinitytec/blocklists/raw/master/ads-and-trackers.txt)

## Scams and phishing
Because they don't deserve your traffic. Blocked include financial schemes, imitation sites, and people trying to take advantage of others.

## Possibilities
Domains that may be problematic. If anyone knows anything about these, please let me know. I do not recommend using this on a daily basis, as they may just break things.

## Not Good Pi
No longer maintained in favor of the more generic scams and phishing list.

# A note on formats:
These blocklists are in hosts format. They work with browser extensions such as [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and with DNS ad blockers such as [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/).

# Do I have a false positive?
Please, create an issue to let me know.

# Is your site on a list and you think it should not be?
Create an issue letting me know. If you make a good case for why I should remove it, I will remove it from the list.
