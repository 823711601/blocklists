# infinitytec's blocklists

## Ads and trackers
Ads and tracking hosts I have seen around the Internet. Some are rare. Some are popular.

[Hosts file format](https://github.com/infinitytec/blocklists/raw/master/ads-and-trackers.txt)

## Scams and phishing
Because they don't deserve your traffic. Blocked include financial schemes, imitation sites, malware, and people trying to take advantage of others through various things including fake news and misleading information.

This blocklist receives the most updates.

## Adfilters
Adfilters in the format used by uBlock Origin and Adblock Plus.

Also receives frequent updates.

## Possibilities
Domains that may be problematic. If anyone knows anything about these, please let me know. I do not recommend using this on a daily basis, as they may just break things.

## Not Good Pi
No longer maintained in favor of the more generic scams and phishing list.

# A note on formats:
These blocklists are in hosts format. They work with browser extensions such as [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and with DNS ad blockers such as [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/).

# Do I have a false positive?
Please, create an issue to let me know.

# Is your site on a list and you think it should not be?
Create an issue letting me know. If you make a good case for why I should remove it, I will remove it from the list.
